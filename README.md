## TODOs:

### Backend

[X] - POST route for create movie

### Datase

[ ] - genre table
[X] - export DB table to json file

### Scripting

[X] - table resets other than whole db

- not really needed, can just copy over exported records.

next up:

going to be really hard to get the joined tables going without a UI, work on that next
